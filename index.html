	    	<h2>About me</h2>
	    		<div>
	    			<p>I am a programmer with a weakness for video games.</p>
	    			<p>
	    				I started playing them in my childhood, and ever since then dreamed about making my own games.
	    				In school I picked a programming class, which sparked my interest in programming in general, so I kept programming throughout the rest of school.

	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				Shortly after I started studying International Media and Computing. It's a major mainly focused on programming for applications in modern media, but also included some more creative elements.
	    				There I finally got to dive deeper into game development, and created my first game projects together with other programmers, artists and designers.
    				</p>
    				<p>
	    				The studies also included a mandatory internship abroad, which I did at a nice little gamestudio in Copenhagen. It was a great experience to work on a commercial product integrated in a team, learning the ins and outs of professional game making.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				Lastly I wrote my Bachelors Thesis about procedural level generation in the Unity3D engine, which concluded my studies.
	    				My next goal is to get a foothold in the games industry and find a creative, fun studio to work at and continue to make better games!
	    			</p>

	    			<h3>Soulspark Battlecards - RPG</h3>

	    			<p>
	    				Soulspark is a realtime battlecard game in which the player follows a group of heroes through their quest.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				It features fast paced strategic battles featuring a large variety of enemies and spells.
	    				The difference to other card games is the realtime aspect. Learn more about the game <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soulsparkgame.com/">here</a>.
	    				I worked on Soulspark during my internship at CopenhagenCreators, and was mainly tasked with bugfixes, polishing and a few final features.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>I was responsible for the audio options as well as the correct handling of audio effects and background music.</p>
	    			<p>The team consisted of 14 people.</p>

	    			<h3>HCA - The ugly Prince Duckling</h3>
	    			<p>
	    				HCA was my main project at CopenhagenCreators. Its goal was to port a game from 2008, made with Ogre3D to Unity3D.
	    				This required a lot of testing and bugfixing, as well as introducing new systems into the existing frame.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				I was also tasked with translating C++ scripts into C# and get them to run in our new implementation of the game.
	    				There were some quirks that needed creative solutions due to the difference of the two engines and languages, but it was always fun to figure them out.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				The team at the times consisted of 3 programmers, one of which led the development.
	    			</p>
	    		</div>
	    		<div id="repeat">
	    			<h3>Repeat</h3>
	    			<p>
	    				Repeat was the first game I worked on.
	    				It was a university project in collaboration with a group of game design students.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				It is a rythm based game for Android in which the player controls a circle and tries to collect as many points as possible.
	    				One requirement was to use some sort of extraordinary controls, so it is controlled through a mix of motion and touch controls.
	    				The easiest way to do this is to hold the device in one hand, steering the circle while activating special objects through tapping or swiping with the other.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				I worked on the project as one of two programmers together with three game designers.
	    				Even though communication between designers and programmers is not always easy, the teamwork was great and gave me a better understanding of how a multidisciplinary team can work and communicate together smoothly.

	    			<h3>Bunny in a Hurry</h3>

	    			<p>
	    				This game was a fun little prototype, created entirely during the Nordic Game Jam 2016.
	    				Its a morbid sidescroller/platformer where the player has to reach the end of the level as fast as possible to not bleed out in the process.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				With a team of five programmers, two artists and a severe lack of time Bunny in a Hurry is obviously missing a lot of polish and is unfinished, but it is playable.
	    				The Jam and our resulting project were stressful but an amazing experience nonetheless.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				If you feel like giving it a try, you can find it here on <a target="_blank" href="https://bunnyteam.itch.io/bunnyinahurry">itch.io</a>.

	    			<h3>Be Bruce Wayne</h3>

	    			<p>
	    				Another GameJam entry!
	    				This is a small text based game, written in Java as a native Android app.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				It was created within 8 hours during the Berlin Mini GameJam April 2016, which took place as part of the 5th International Independent Videogames Festival in Berlin.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				The team consisted of three people, the main programmer, a designer and me, helping out with programming but mainly supplying the text and choices the players can take in the game.
